# 4 - Exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a process in which we summarise and visually explore a dataset.
An important part of EDA is unsupervised learning, which is a collection of methods for finding interesting subgroups and patterns in our data. 
Unlike statistical hypothesis testing, which is used to reject hypotheses, EDA can be used to generate hypotheses
(which can then be confirmed or rejected by new studies). Another purpose of EDA is to find outliers and incorrect observations,
which can lead to a cleaner and more useful dataset.

## 4.1 Reports with R Markdown

### Formatting text

To create plain text in a Markdown file, you simply have to write plain text. 
If you wish to add some formatting to your text, you can use the following:

- _italics_ or *italics*: to create text in italics.

- __bold__ or **bold**: to create bold text.

- [linked text](http://www.modernstatisticswithr.com): to create linked text.

- `code`: to include inline code in your document.

- to create inline equations like a2+b2=c2 using LaTeX syntax:  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

- to create a centred equation on a new line: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$: 

...


### Lists, tables, and images


To create a **bullet list**, you can use * as follows. Note that you need a blank line between your list and the previous paragraph to begin a list.

* Item 1
* Item 2
   + Sub-item 1
   + Sub-item 2
* Item 3


To create an **ordered list**, use:

1. First item
2. Second item
  i) Sub-item 1
  ii) Sub-item 2
3. Item 3

To create a **table**, use | and --------- as follows:

Column 1  | Column 2
--------- | ---------
Content  | More content
Even more  | And some here
Even more?  | Yes!


To include an **image**, use the same syntax as when creating linked text with a link to the image path 
(either local or on the web), but with a ! in front:

![The R logo.](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)


### Code chunks

In RStudio, **Ctrl+Alt+I** is a keyboard shortcut for inserting this kind of code chunk:

```{r}

```

We can add a name and a caption to the chunk, which lets us reference objects created by the chunk:

```{r pressureplot, fig.cap = "Plot of the pressure data."}
plot(pressure)
```

As we can see in Figure \@ref(fig:pressureplot), the relationship between temperature and pressure resembles a banana.

In addition, you can add settings to the chunk header to control its behaviour:

- echo = FALSE      to run the code without printing it,
- eval = FALSE      to print the code without running it,
- results = "hide"  to hide printed output,
- fig.show = "hide" to hide plots,
- warning = FALSE   to suppress warning messages from being printed in your document,
- message = FALSE   to suppress other messages from being printed in your document,
- include = FALSE   to run a chunk without showing the code or results in the document,
- error = TRUE      to continue running your R Markdown document even if there is an error in the chunk 
                    (by default, the documentation creation stops if there is an error).


Data frames can be printed either as in the Console or as a nicely formatted table. 

For example:

```{r}
head(airquality)
```
whereas yields a nicely formatted table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(
  head(airquality),
  caption = "Some data I found."
)
```
